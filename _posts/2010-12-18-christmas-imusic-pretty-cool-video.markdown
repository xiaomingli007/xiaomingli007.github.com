I never thought I would be writing about iPads or anything like that, considering how worthless I feel they are. Despite this, I got an email that had a pretty cool attachment on it that had to deal with iPads and iPhones. I added it below, it’s actually pretty cool.

If you only listen to a little bit of it, I would recommend the first song, seeing as it’s the best. Pretty wacky looking people doing it, but cool nonetheless.
