After typing “User Interface Blog” on Google looking for a relevant blog to write about, I came across the website by the name of [UX Movement][1]. It is written by Anthony Tseng, who has a degree in cognitive science with a specialization in human-computer interaction. Sound fitting right? People who study cognitive science would know a lot about how people think and how they interact with the world around them. After finding the authors background information, I figured that I would be able to read some of this dude’s blog and take something from it.

After glancing as some of the topics, I actually found it interesting, unlike some of the reading I have had to do for this class. The home page alone drew me in. Now I have more to read, which I’m not sure is a good thing at this point in time, which will help me learn more about this topic.
